### Why this project :
I'm learning web development because that interest me. Now the purpose of this project, that's to practice hmtl, css, javascript, BEM naming convention and react so front-end developement. Some part of this project are hard coded because that's not interesting to do it twice. I already implement a private chat inside a social media and document the solution already for back-end and front-end too if you are interested you can take a look here : https://github.com/Xavier-Pierre-dev/MERN-Social-Media-project. 

### What i learn and practice from this project :
  - BEM naming convention and i find this convention really great for when we want to make a new style of a component, we can easily see which modifiers and children already exist. Finally this convention make the process for writting css/html more clean and easier to understand. 
  - Quick set up a firebase database for work on the front end and also have some advantage in front of mongoose alone like realtime database and that's a requirement for doing chat or private message. 
  - Practicing React/javascript/hmtl/css
